-   **Be specific with your pursuits**
    
    One of the things you can be sure of in life is that you don't get something you don't aim at. Often people will keep their goals vague. One of the problems with specifying your goals is you also need to outline the parameters for your failures. By keeping your goal vague, you're not sure when you fail. That means you can fool yourself. Keep your goals sharp and clear.
