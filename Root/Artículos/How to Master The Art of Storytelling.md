According to a recent study, 65% of our conversations are stories and gossip. Everything’s about story, but sometimes in the world of business, we become so logical because it’s all numbers and deadlines that we must meet. We forget that so many challenges in our business can be tackled if we decide to appeal to the emotion rather than logic, and the only way to do that is through storytelling.

# **In this article we’re going to talk about the art of storytelling.**

Everyone loves good stories; we love stories in books and we go watch movies that have great stories. If you think about historical leaders, you will often think of the great storytellers like Shakespeare, Homer, MLK JR, Lincoln, Eminem, Churchill, President Clinton, Walt Disney, Reagan, Tupac or Biggie.

1. Those who persuade
2. Those who inspire
3. Those who launch revolutions & movements
4. Those who tap into your potential
5. Those who manipulate (con artists)

In 1450 the game was completely changed by the printing press. Stories went from word of mouth to being able to go on paper on a large scale like never seen. Now there was a way to do mass distribution of storytelling. In 1890 came the motion picture camera led by the TV in 1925. This was when storytelling started to become big business through the media, the entertainment industry and Hollywood. Now social media and blogs have become a way to spread stories and keep storytelling constantly in front of everyone.
