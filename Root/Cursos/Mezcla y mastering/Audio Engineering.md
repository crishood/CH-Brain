## Clase 1

Artist is the boss in the studio.

Record companies don't hire producers, artist do.

Producer =! Beatmaker.

The team:

- Producer: Creative mind. Major decisions. Shape the song. Director of the film.
- Engineer: Recording and mixing.
- Assistant Engineer.
- Runner: The guy of the coffee.
- Mastering Engineer: Consistency in the volume.

## Clase **2**

Sound: Sound is physics.

The science of matter and energy and of interactions between two.

Vibratory disturbances in a gas, liquid or solid medium.

Our ears gather these vibrations and with the help of brain stem, allow us to interpret them as sound.

Molecules striking one and another becoming densely compressed are called condensations. Compression station has the crest.

Rarefaction station has the trough.

Sound is a longitudinal wave. The particles of the medium move in a direction parllel to the direction of energy transport.

**The cycle**

Sounds waves can be captured electronically and viewed where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is pressure, or the density of medium.

**Waveform Characteristics**

**Amplitude:** Is the loudness. The more intense vibration, the greater pressure variation meaning more molecules are displaced. Amplitude is volume. The decibel is the unit that measures the intensity of sounds. 0db spl (sound pressure level).

**Frequency:** Number of cycles that a vibration completes in one second. Is measured in Hertz, Hz. The higher the frequency, the higher the perceived pitch of the sound. Humans are capable of hearing frequencies from 20Hz to 20000 Hz which is divided into 10 octaves. 1Khz test tone is used to test radio, tv and many other things. 1000 Cycles per second (CPS).

**Velocity:** The speed which sound travels.

In the air is about 1130 feet per second.

In the water is 4800 ft/ sec.

In solid materials 18000 ft/ sec.

**Wavelength:** The physical distance from one compression point to the next is called the wavelength.

Length = Velocity / Frequency.

**Phase:** Phase is the travel of a sound wave. Phase is measured in degrees. The beginning of the wave starts a t 0 degrees, the peaks are at 90, the troughs are at 270 while the end is at 360.

**Envelope:** The rise and fall in volume. An envelope has four sections: Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release. Changes in amplitude over time.

**Pitch:** How the brain interprets the frequency of an emitted sound is called the pitch. Remember we have 10 octaves.

**Frequency Spectrum:**

Low Bass > 1st & 2nd Octaves (20Hz - 80Hz) FEEL.

Upper Bass > 3rd & 4th Octaves (80Hz - 320Hz) BASS.

Low Midrange > 5th, 6th, 7th Octaves (320Hz - 2560Hz) BODY.

Upper Midrange > 8th Octave (2560Hz - 5120Hz) PRESENCE.

Treble > 9th & 10th Octave (5120Hz - 20000Hz) BRILLIANCE AND AIR.

**Timbre:** Tone quality or tone colour. Most musical notes have more than one frequency component and create a complex waveform.

The lowest frequency  in a complex wave is called fundamental frequency. It determine the pitch of the sound.

Higher frequencies in the complex wave are called overtones or upper partials.

If the overtones are integral multiples of the fundamental frequency, they are called harmonics.

**Frequency vs Amplitude inthe human ear**

What a human perceives as loud or soft depends on the frequency as well as the amplitude.

Ear is highly sensitive to frequencies between 2.5kHz and 5kHz. Human voice range.

## Clase **3**

**Signal flow**

From - To

Phase and signal flow, don't break these rules.

Source - Destination - Source - Destination - Source… Output - Input - Output - Input…

From - To - From - To…

Signal flow is the path an audio signal takes from source to output.

Where the sounds come from? Where the sounds go to?

SIgnal flow and phase are the most important things to know as an engineer.

The order is important.

Think of it like plumbing. If you open a faucet, water flows FROM the tap to the sink. Water is not flowing to the faucet from the sink. It is the same with audio.

**Feedback**

Feedback occurs when the output of a device is accidentally connected to its input. If the device is amplifying the signal, then the amplified output will be fed back into the input, where it will be amplified again and sent to the output, where it will return to the input, be amplified again, and sent to the output, ad infinitum. An understanding of signal flow is important preventing feedback.

**Signal Flow - Single source to single destination.**

Singer > Mic > Preamp > EQ > Comp > ADC.

2. DAW Control

Every Console has a master control.

Meter bridge is the part where you see the volume.

Patch Bay.

**Channel:** A functional path in an audio circuit. Channel Strip ( I/O ) = Input / Output Module.

Boost: To increase or make louder, as in moving a fader upwards.

Attenuate.

**Fader:** Another name for an audio level control.

**Pot, Potentiometer:** In electronics, a variable resistor that varies the potential or voltage.

Stereo = L + R

**Bus:** An electrical connection common to more than one circuit.

**Assign or Route:** In sound mixers, assign means to switch or route a signal to a particular signal path.

**Sub-Master:** Controls used to “group” signal together so as to have a master control of many sources.

**Monitor:** Term used for listening to signal. Ears to hear, eyes to see.

**Auxiliary:**  Examples of auxiliary equipment include: (compressors, limiters, gates) and parallel processors: (reverb and delay).

All consoles have aux send buses and aux return inputs to accommodate auxiliary equipment.

**Level:** Another word for signal voltage, power, strength or volume.

**Gain:** Same as level.

**Headroom:** The difference between nominal operating level and peak clipping in an audio system. The larger the area the better the signal to noise ratio and dynamic range.

**Mic level:** The typical low-level signal from a microphone. These signals are considered to be very weak and delicate. They must be amplified to be used further.

**Mic preamp:** Short for microphone preamplifier. An amplifier that functions to bring the very low signal level of a microphone up to console line level. Setting the mic preamp gain correctly is an essential step in establishing good noise and headroom in the channel.

**Line level:** Standard level in which all audio in the control room operates.

**Instrument level:** Nominal signal from musical instruments using electrical pickups or electronic pre-amps.

**Trim:** Usually a gain adjustment where the signal cannot completely be turned off.

**Unity gain:** A circuit or system that has its voltage gain adjusted to be 1:1.

**Clipping:** A cause of severe audio distortion is the result of excessive gain requiring the peaks of the audio signal to rise above the capabilities of the amplifier circuit.

**Noise:** Undesired sounds. Electronic or acoustic.

**Noise Floor:** The residual level of noise in any system.

**Gain staging audio:** All electronic processors have a similar architecture.

- Noise floor.
- Operating range.
- Distortion.

**Phantom Power:** DC voltage required to power condenser microphones and active direct boxes.

Usually 48 volts that is applied through resistors in the microphone equally to 2 pins and 3 of the mic connector.

Incidentally, the microphone uses the same 2 conductors to receive and send audio as well.

**SOLO - AFL - PFL:**

- Solo: The ability of a console to audition an individual element from many.

## Clase **06**

**Meters & Metering**

The meters are the visual representation of how much signal your device can handle.

**Meter types**

- VU Meter = Volume unit. Designed by Bell Labs in 1939. It’s a mechanical meter that consists of a metal needle in the center surrounded by two small electromagnets on either side of it. This meter was designed to closely correspond to the level sensing mechanism of the human ear. Is not good to give us peak signal levels. A VU meter displays the average volume level of an audio signal or it’s RMS component. 0VU = + 4dbm.
- PPM = Peak Program Meter. Developed in 1948 by the BBC. Designed to capture peak signal level instead of average signal level. The PPM has a fast attack or around 10ms compared to the VU meters slow 300ms attack time. The PPM meter is measured in units of decibels. Each number is a change of 4db in level. PPM5 = 0VU.
- Peak Meter = Indicates the instantaneous level of an audio signal that is passing through it. In the professional level, we use Hi-Res Peak Meters. Peak hold is a function that stores the max peak in the time. The purpose of this meter is to prevent signal overload from high amplitude transients.
- Combination VU/ PEAK Meter.
- DBFS Meter = decibels below full scale. This is the digital meter.

**Measuring Signal level**

The signal level can be measured by two points on the cycle.

1. Peak level
2. Average = RMS

CHOP = Channel Output Path. This goes to the DAW.

Mixing Headphones = CUE or FEEDBACK.

## Clase **7**

Sound theory, Console and mics.

**Mics**

Transducer: A device that converts one form of energy into another.

The mic is the most important transducer in sound. It converts air pressure (acoustic enerfy) into electric energy (The signal).

This electrical siganl is then amplified and modified at the console.

We are interested in in the accuracy of this transformation, a concept known as fidelity.

Mics has color/ personality.

The diaphragm of a microphone is a mechanical link that interfaces between the acoustic enviroment and the electrical generation of a signal.

This diaphragm can be made out thin metal film or a thin opaque plastic material, sometimes coated using gold or nickel.

Microphone Anatomy > Capsule - Body - Connector (XLR male connector)

C 12 AKG > Expensive 50s model.

Manufacturers:

- AKG
- Neumamm
- Senheiser
- Shure
- Rhode
- Audio Technica

### **Microphone design**

**Dynamic microphone or magneto-dynamic:** the diaphragm is attached to a coil of fine wire. The coil is mounted in the air gap of the magnet and is free to move back and forth.

**Ribbon microphone:** Works on the same electrical principal as the dynamic microphone with the exception that a thin metal foil, or ribbon, is suspended in a magnetic field. The ribbon mike, is also called a pressure gradient microphone.

**Condenser microphone:** The condenser or capacitor microphone operates on an electrostatic principle rather than the electromagnetic principle used by dynamic and ribbon microphones.

In a condeser microphone, the diagragm is a very thin plastic film, coated on one side with gold or nickel, and mounted very close to conductive back plate. 48 v dc.

The diaphragm and back plate are separated by a small volume of air, forming an electrical component called a capacitor.

A capacitor is an electrical device that storages a small amount of energy.

**Electrec:** Another kind of condensor design is called a ELECTRET and uses a material with a permanently imprinted charge for the diaphragm.

### **Specifications in microphones**

Sensitivity = is a measure of how much electrical output (in volts) is produced by a given mic. A higher sensitivity produces a stronger output signal.

Overload = SPL ratings of mics at 120db/SPL are good while ratings of 150db/SPL are excellent. Dynamic microphones are able to handle loud signal levels.

Trasient response = is a measurement of how quickly the diaphragm  responds to an acoustic waveform. Condenser mics are the fastest.

Frequency response = A flat frequency response has been the main goal o microphone companies for many decades. This effort has now paid off to the point were most expensive professional microphones are respectably flar, at least for sounds originating in front.

### **Microphones characteristics**

Moving coil mics are well suited for high sound pressure level applications. Less sensitive to humidity and wide temperature variations. Slower transient response. If you think loud you think dynamic.

Ribbon mics it’s transient response is between the moving coil and the condenser mic. These have the lowest output level so they are liked for warn and smooth quality. Good for clean guitars.

Condenser mics provide a clear detailed sound with a very wide frequency response. High sensitivity good for quiet sounds. Clean and accurate signal.

### **Pick up patterns (Polar response)**

Sounds originating from directly in front are called On-Axis sound.

Sounds in the surrounding area are called.

Clarity issues are known as microphone spill, bleed or leakage.

The polar pattern is a plot of the coverage of a mic.

There are several common polar pattern types used in microphones today.

### **Omni-Directional:** Meaning literally, from all directions.

**Cardioid:** Sensitive in the front and rejection of back sound. A heart-shaped.

**Bidirecional:** A mic that is able to pick up sound from the front and the rear.

**Hyper-cardiod:** They pick up a little bit of sound of the back position.

**Super-cardiod:** Slightly less directional.

**Ultra-cardiod:** The narrowest pick up. Shotgun microphone for the distance.

**More characteristics**

Capsule symmetry: symmetrical pickup or front addres o A-Symmetrical pickup design or side address.

Multipattern microphones by using two diaphragms.

Proximity effect > This is an increase in low frequency response of a microphone when the sound source is in very close working range.

## Clase 8

**Mics in studio 1**

**Crown PZM 185**

Pressure zone microphone.

Ideal for table top applications such as interviews.

The mic can be placed on a large surface such as a table, floor or wall.

Try it in a kick drum or underneath the piano lid.

**Mic phasing**

Comb filter effect is because the frequency response looks like the teeth of an inverted hair comb.

**Mono sum**

If two mics pick up the same sound source at different distances, and their signals are fed to the same channel.

And the Gods gave us the… 3 to 1 rule.

The distance between mics should be at least three times the 1st mic-to-source distance.

4:1 ratio is even more better.

If the mics are spread out even further this become less of problem.

**Tips and techniques**

Mic close.

Spread instruments farther apart.

Use directional mics, and angle the mics away from each other.

Don’t use two mics when one will do the job.

Watch out for reflections off hard surfaces like walls and glass.

Use baffles around instruments when your recording more than one at a time.

**Stereophonic microphone techniques**

A-B Stereo technique or time difference stereo, as s it is sometimes called - uses two spaced Omni or cardiod microphones to record audio signals.

Baffled stereo: a spaced micrphone stereo technique using an acoustic absorbent baffle between microphones.

Coincidence stereo: This technique uses directional microphones to create the stereo image. The stereo width is set by the individual microphone’s polar pattern. Among the more well known coincidence stereo techniques are XY stereo, MS-Stereo and Blumleim.

XY = Mics overlap.

NOS = Mics are spaced 30 cm apart and angled at 90 degrees.

MS = One cardioid microphone and one bi directional microphone in the same point and angled 90 degrees creating a stereo image through a MS-matrix.

Blumlein = The Blumlein stereo set-up is a coincidence stereo technique, which uses two bi-directional microphones angled at 90 degrees to one and another. The blumlein stereo has a higher channel separation than the XY stereo, and sound sources located behind the stereo pair also will be picked up and reproduced.

Decca tree = The tree consists of a three-point pick-up by omni directional microphones in a (often equilateral) triangle pointing at the sound source. The two outside microphones are so far apart that a @hole in the middle@ will occur without adding the centre mic.

The centre mic should be mixed in to fill up this hole, taking care not to make the sound perspective too mono.

Binaural stereo = ASMR.

**Direct Box (Interface but not digital)**

Is an useful “audio interface”

Used to bypass amplifiers to record guitar, bass, electronic keyboards, synths and drum machines without the use of an amplifier.

AKA as a direct I/O or direct injection signal.

**USAGE**

There are times that trying to record a electronic instrument while micing an amplifier results in a signal that sounds weak, muddy and simply unusable.

Why? Because of resistance, impedance and electronic balancing.

Resistance = opposition to the flow of current in a circuit can be called resistance.

Impedance = quite simply impedance is a measurement of resistance as well.

High impedance = less quality.

Low impedance = more quality. All professional devices are low impedance.

Signal flow = Balanced = 2 conductor & shield (3 wires). The purpose of the shield is to provide defense against unwanted interference.

Unbalanced = 1 conductor & shield (2 wires). Mono cable, guitar or keyboard cable.

DIRECT BOX = Change instruments high source impedance to a low impedance feed to the console. Electronically isolate the output signal by balancing the unbalanced signal. Reduce the instruments output level to a microphone’s level for amplification by the console’s preamps.

**Active vs Passive**

Active = Needs power to work. 48v.

Passive = Uses a transformer to operate and no power is needed.

## Clase 10

**Patch Fields and Interconnection**

Patch Bay is a panel located on or near the console which interconnects all of the console’s physical components and the various pieces of equipment found in a control room. The patch bay provides the operator flexibility to route or reroute signals to and from other piece of equipment.

## Clase 11

Learn how to group, combine and sub-mix signal. Time to make commitments.

Prior to the DAW age, finished productions were restricted by the number if tracks available by the tape machines. 

Sub-Grouping Signal: To combine multiple signals on one or more busses.

There are mono and stereo busses. 

Usage: To reduce microphone count to a smaller track layout in record stage. (Beds & OD’s)

To reduce number of recorded tracks to a fewer count. (Track bounce)

To mix tracks in groups for easier manipulation and processing. (Mix)

Bed tracks: In the bed session it may be common to use many microphones to record instruments.

Track bouncing: This technique is used to combine or “bounce together” tracks that have already been recorded. Sometimes known as a “STEM”.

Do not confuse this with bouncing out tracks with a DAW, track bouncing means combining tracks and re recording them to fresh new tracks.

Record lead vocals and then bounce to a new track. Delete the original 3 tracks.

SSL Duality sub groups functions

Any channels can be assigned to the 24 available busses on the Duality.

Put the channel in BUS mode. (MIC mode, LINE mode, SPLIT mode).

Route signal from SOURCE to DESTINATION.

EXPANDERS / NOISE GATES

A processing device in which the dynamic range of the output signal is greater than that of the input signal.

A signal processing device used to increase the dynamic range of the signal passing through it.

An expander is another form of automatic level control. By attenuating the signal below the threshold, the expander reduces low-level noise thus expanding the apparent dynamic range of the recorded material.

Gates and Expanders are primarily noise management devices.

Unwanted noise is the enemy of all parts of the recording process.

Unwanted noise can be caused by the recorded environment or can be generated by, or in, the recording/ processing circuitry or storage medium.

Once noise has been added to an electrical signal, there is really no way or removing it later.

If the signal level could be turned down or muted during these pauses, the background hiss would also be turned down.

Like a compressor, there is a threshold set by the engineer.

An expander tends to widen dynamic range, rather than restrict it because our impression is that the signal is louder now due to the lack of background noise riding on the signal.

The ratios of an expander are inverse (backwards) to that compressor 1:2, 1:3, 1:4. At a 1:2 ratio, 1 dB of input expands down 2 dB of output resulting in a noise reduction improvement of 2dB.

GATE VS EXPANSION

A gate is designed to kill the audio signal path when the input signal falls below a threshold.

An expander is similar, nut is essentially a soft knee curve that removes part but not all of the signal.

Typical Expander/ Gate functions

Threshold.

Attack: Determine how long it takes the gate to fully open once the input signal exceeds the threshold.

Release: Sets the time over which the gate will close.

Depth/ Range: This control allows a selectable amount of signal to pass even when the gate is closed. In other words the depth can be set to remove all of the signal or remove only some of the signal. Called expansion.

Hold: This control stops the expander from entering the release mode for a predetermined time after the input falls below threshold.

The final word Amplitude Processing Summary

Compressor/ Limiter: An amplifier whose gain decreases as its input level increases.

Expander: An amplifier whose gain decreases as input level also decreases.

Threshold: The level at which a compressor, limiter or expander begins functioning.

Reverb & Delay

Perception of space. The ear and the brain have the remarkable ability to locate sound, perceive distance, and formulate a physical sense of acoustic space.

Hard surfaces such as walls are reflective by nature and will bounce the sound waves back to the listener/ microphone. Softer surfaces are more abosrtive and direct less energy back.

Also low frequencies tend to be somewhat omni-directional when they spread out.

The sound wave travels a straight line from the source to the listener, follows th shortest path. This is called direct sound.

Those waves that bounce off surrounding surfaces must travel further or a longer path therefore arrive after the direct sound.

As a resul of these reflections, the ear will hear the sound even after the sound source stops emitting it, and the amount of time that these reflections lasts determines the type of category they will fit into.

Delay Length: In terms of distance: 1 millisecond of reflection (delay) equals about 1 foot in distance. 

The sound heard in an acoustic space can be divided in three categories:

1.  Direct sound: Direct sound is classified as sound waves which reach the listener without reflecting off surrounding surfaces. Direct sound will follow a straight path from the source to it’s destination, the listener or microphone. 
    
2.  Early reflections: Sounds that reach the ear within 30ms after the direct sound takes place. Although they are perceived the same as direct sound, it is the time elapsed between the two that provides the ear with information about the size of the performance space adding fullness and amplitude to the original sound source. 
    
3.  Reverberation: Is classified as densely spaced reflections which have been bounced off many surfaces and come from many different directions. The ear interprets them as continuous stream of information. These multiple reflections usually start at or around 50 ms time period and may last for seconds. They generally add warmth and body to the sound source.
    
4.  Echo.
    

 RT 60 Reverb Time:

The time it takes for the sound pressure level to decay by 60db or (1/1000th) from it’s original amplitude is decay time or reverberation time and is abbreviated as RT60.

The brain perceives this decay time and it’s timbre and uses it to form an opinion of the hardness or softness of the surrounding surfaces.

Once the path of reflections become longer they are perceived more and more as distinct repetitions of the direct sound and start to exhibit greater sonic clarity.

Direct and reverberant fields

In a space indoors or outdoors the reverberant field plays a very important role on the quality of the sound source.

If the direct sound from a source that reaches  you is louder than the reflections, then you are considered to be in the direct field.

The ratio of Direct vs Reverberant signal is responsible for our perception of the distance from the source.

Summary

Direct sound provides the listener with information about the source size, location and timbre.

The time between the direct sound and the early reflections determines the size of the performance space.

Types of reverb units

Acoustic reverb chamber 1950 - 1960: The acoustic echo chamber is one of the earliest types of artificial reverb devices to be used will reasonable success. 

In it’s basic form it is a room or space with highly reflective surfaces that have a loudspeaker.

Spring reverb: By applying a signal from a small voice coil to a metal coil (spring) the effect of signal delay can be accomplished.

This is very similar to connecting two Styrofoam cups together with a string.

AKG BX20: Big spring unit.

EMT 40 Reverb Plate 1957: The plate reverb is similar to the spring reverb with the exception that a plate of metal instead.

Digital reverb: In the late 70’s the first generation of digital reverbs came out. Hardware “Rack units” that come with very complex algorithms are still highly favored.

Acoustic room simulation.

Software Plug-in reverb: We are now finally at the point of good to excellent software emulation and quality plug-in’s designed by companies like UAD.

Reverb Parameters

1.  Reverb decay: How long the reflections are.
    
2.  Pre-delay: Change the start of delay.
    
3.  Diffusion: Increasing diffusion pushes the early reflections closer together, which thickens the timbre.
    

Delayed reverb: Delay plugin before reverb.

Gated reverb: The idea is to “chop-off” the reverb before it ends.

Delay

This can be used independent of reverb. Sometimes a delay effect will work better.

Doubling, flanging and chorus can be made with delay. Slapback delay. Discrete echo. 

Input/ Output.

Feedback, repeat, spin, regenaration.
