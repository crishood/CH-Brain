### **Songs**

Way of doing things will work. FUNCTION. Methodology.

Knowing the first way is useful.

Do things from a place of knowledge.

Form is NOT formula.

### **Standard Song Structure**

A standard song has a verse and a chorus.

It can also have an intro, pre-chorus, bridge, solo section, outro, ending and/or coda.

**Intro:** The beginning, the entry to create a mood to draw the listener in.

**Verse:** The verse tell us the story lyrically. Dynamically low.

**Pre-Chorus:** Sets up the chorus or bridge between verse and chorus, the climb. (Optional)

**Chorus:** The payoff, the theme, the title, dynamically high (usually).

Come together - The Beatles.

## Clase 4

You belong with me - Taylor Swift Produced by Nathan Chapman.

Very classic standard song.

### **Bridge**

Non-essential, middle eight is another name to call it. There to break up the repetitive nature of the verse/pre-chorus/chorus. It is up to you to use it how you want.

Bridge has a unique melody and chord structure that takes us away from a verse and chorus that are very similar.

### **Outro or Coda**

The end or final act.

Let's Go - The Cars Produced by Roy Thomas Baker (1979)

Love Can Be So Mean - Sebastien Granger and The Mountains (2008)

### **Other Song Structures**

### **AABA**

There are no verses and choruses in an AABA structure.

Sometimes called the 32 bar format as often each section will be 8 bars in length.

**A** contains the theme and or title like a chorus. But also contains varying lyric information like a verse. It's like a verse and a chorus.

**B** acts sort of like a bridge.

You always need to solve with **A** part.

        1. Bass. Record amp and DI. Edit between takes tune that bass.
        2. Guitars. Start with the instrument itself, in tune. Getting sounds, guitar amp, pedals, mic, preamp. Start at the source. Different sounds for different sections of the song, solos, ad lib guitars Layering. Should you take a DI?
        3. Solos. More adventurous with sounds. Make sure sounds cuts through beds.

        9. Last minute sweetening?

### **Vocal Harmonies**

Harmonies should be worked out in advance.

You can find the notes on a guitar or piano.

Your harmony should follow the chord and not necessarily the melody.

Harmonies should be recorded one at a time to maintain control over level and eq.

The one exception would be gang vocals.

### **Studio and budget outline**

**10 Songs**

**Choosing a Studio**

Budget is a first consideration.

Is the gear and room suitable for your needs?

You may need different studios for beds and overdubs.

Big room for drums but not necessarily for overdubs.

Always choose the best place you can afford.

Studio website.

Studio tour-meet the people, see the facility.

Engineer website.

Studio tour-meet the people, see the facility.

The engineer is a crucial element of any studio decision.

Using the staff engineer or bringing in your own guy.

Relationship with engineer will help determine the success of the project.

Will the studio give you a break on the rate if you bring your own guy?

There is no substitute for experience.

You must feel confident.

### **Studio Prep**

Intonate guitars.

Neew strings on guitars, new skins on drums.

Bring a guitar/drum tech.

Recording list, made up during pre pro.

Good, working hard drive.

Make sure band’s cables all work.

Have a good quality, accurate tuner.

Guitar tracks how many different sounds will you need?

Band should bring any amps, guitars, pedals they can get their hands on.

Can you use a generic guitar sound for most/all the rhythm guitars?

Each sound requires a set up.

Work out keyboard patches in advance, (if possible)

How good are your musicians?

### **Recording Schedule**

Ten hours is a good studio day.

For ten songs.

Drums 3 days.

Bass guitar a day and a half to two days.

Guitars 3 days (How many set ups?)

Other overdus 2 days.

Vocals 5 days.

Mix flat rate.

You must factor in breaks, musician fatigue, meals, comping and possible gear issues.

Don’t rush the vocals.

### **Mix**

Using tracking engineer.

Knows the material, part of the process.

Bringing in a Mix Engineer.

Brings fresh ears to the project.

Often specializes in mixing.

May bring creative element to the mix.

You are the producer, the mix is still your responsibility.

Either you trust your engineer to do his or her thing or are you involved in mix decisions.

You can be in the room or review mixes at end of the day or via internet.

Digital recording makes total recall a reality.

Don’t work with anyone will not do mix revisions.

Listen at home, in car etc. and make sure the mix works for you and the artist.

### **Budget**

Beds 3 days at $800 a day $2400

Overdubs including vocals 12 days at $350 a day $4200.

Mix $400 a song $4000

Hard drive $125

Guitar tech $250

Instrument rentals $100

Stringsm sticks, skins $150

Guest musician $200

Contingency $500

Your fee $2000

Total not including tax, $13,525

Mastering $1000 or less.

Stick to your budget but create a relationship with the artist that allows both of you to be flexible,

Make sure they have the money to pay for everything.

Many studios and engineers want to be paid immediately at the end of the sessions.

You will typically be paid half up front and half when the mastering is done.

Get your advance and signed paperwork before you start tracking.

What can give you a reliable outcome?

Don’t under budget.
