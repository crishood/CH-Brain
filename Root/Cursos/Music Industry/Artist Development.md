**[Passion, drive and Enthusiasm]**

In the past 10 - 12 years the music industry has undergone incredible change. How has it changed and what factor(s) caused that change and how has this affected today’s artist?

To be successful now an artist must...

### **Every story has already been told**

They say that every story has already been told. The only thing writers do is change scenarios and characters. The success story within music is no exception. The music industry, which is the stage, and the artists, which are the characters, have changed over time, but the way they reach success remains intact. From the medieval trouvère who sang about military feats before a royal court, through the bands of the nineties who went from playing in their garages to filling stadiums, to contemporary bedroom rappers reaching the top positions of the Billboards, all these characters have had two things in common: discipline to create and intelligence to get to the right ears.

Over the past two decades, the supply of music-making tools has diversified thanks to the exponential growth in the storage and processing capacity of personal computer hard drives. This has allowed software and hardware developers to create different applications and affordable devices for recording music. The rise of DAWs and sound interfaces has caused more people to venture into creating music, increasing variety, and competition. The democratization of the tools has made more artists able to pursue success within the industry, because they can now produce songs at a lower cost than 30 years ago.

With the diversification of the tools to produce music also came the pluralization of the spaces in which it is recorded. Thanks to portable technologies artists can now make their productions from their bedrooms. A good example of this is Venezuelan artist Danny Ocean who this year released his successful debut album 54 + 1, which he composed, recorded and mixed from his room. The process of creation is now simpler than ever, as is the process of distribution and promotion which, thanks to the internet, is now cheaper.

Now the internet is the most important tool for the promotion and distribution of music. With platforms like Spotify, YouTube or Apple Music, artists can showcase their creations to the world with or without a label to back them up. Through Instagram or Facebook, a band can make itself known and find its niche. This variety of channels demands that artists learn to reach the right ears through the use of digital marketing strategies and SEO (Search Engine Optimization). Today the artist has affordable tools for the creation, promotion, and distribution of his music.

The music industry has become a giant and varied scenario, full of characters with diverse styles. Laptops have become small workstations for recording, composing and mixing. The dormitories of many houses became the new recording studios and now in the garages where they used to rehearse, with a little work you can also record the whole band. The most benefited from the offer of tools has been the artist. Although the characters and scenario have changed, the quest for success remains intact as does the way to get there. No matter how easy it is to acquire a DAW and an interface, if an artist doesn't have the discipline to create he won't get anywhere. No matter how cheap it is to pay for advertising on Instagram or Google Ads, if you don't know what your niche is, the right people won't listen to you.

The successful medieval trouvère had the discipline to compose and the intelligence to sneak into some duke's court to be listened; the successful band of the nineties had the discipline to practice weekdays in the garage and the courage to knock on the right bars on weekends; the successful contemporary artist must be consistent and disciplined to create his music with a DAW and an interface, and intelligent and brave to bring his sound to the right ears through digital marketing and SEO. Same story, different scenarios and characters.
